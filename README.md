Project For Nathan 

Task Steps:

1. Build simple Incident management Suite with 1 or 2 features
2. Make it so we can add or remove users
3. Nathan wants to see when an ticket is changed in severity or if a ticket is updated

Task for myself:

1. make it responsive
2. make dynamic loader of incidents
3. improve GUI and UX of dashboards 
4. add time tracker
5. mobile sms alerts
6. native ios / android loop in now?

How I made this?
Meteor.js (http://meteor.com) and Mongo DB (https://www.mongodb.com/) on the backend- 
why: fast, fluid, one language across client, server, and mobile app / browser
     uses data on the wire technology, meaning dynamically populated information for us to remap the UI as you will see in the example
     full stack reactivity
 Also meteor and mongo are already deployed in HUGE enterprise environments such as mazda, nike, and many other large companies where information is dynamically displayed in live time, proving perfect use cases for possible large deployments of data across many environments
 
 MongoDB is also oneof the only fully scalable, relation databases available
 

Meteor hosted at : http://Meteor.com/Galaxy
MongoDB hosted at: http://compose.com

Front End is Angular 2

why?: I wanted to try out the angular 2 language as it is quickly becoming a replacement for Angular 1, I utilized the material design package ( https://github.com/angular/material2) because I wanted to keep the design minimalist as I did not know where theoritically it would evolve into being needed. Thre true beauty of Angular is the fact again, your writing one code base for multiple deployment paths. This allows what information is displayed, how it is displayed, and what is happening all to be completely customized on the fly. 


 All of the code is written in TypeScript
